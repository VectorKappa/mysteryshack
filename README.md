# mysteryshack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/mysteryshack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/mysteryshack)

This is the work-in-progress of a new
[remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io/)-server. Goals:

* Be *lightweight* in CPU- and RAM-usage, but only at runtime, not necessarily
  compilation time.

* Be *user-friendly*. There is no such thing as over-protective.
